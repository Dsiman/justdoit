# 🛠️ justdoit - *Just Complete One Project*

Welcome to our S&Box project template and testbed.  
This repo is set up to help multiple people work together effectively on a single project — including game systems, models, and documentation.

## 🎮 Part 1 - S&Box Setup

### Set Default IDE to Visual Studio Code

1. Go to `Edit` > `Preferences`.
2. Under the **General** tab, set your **Code Editor** to `Visual Studio Code`.

### 🧩 Adding a Model

#### Step 1: Import Your Model

- Drop the model (`.fbx`, `.obj`, etc.) and its textures into an appropriate subfolder inside `Assets/Models`.
- Name the folder based on the model's **use or type**.

#### Step 2: Create the `.vmdl`

- Right-click the **main model file** and choose **"Create Model..."**.
- This generates a `.vmdl` — the format Source 2 uses for in-game models.

#### Step 3: Fix Materials (if needed)

- Double-click the `.vmdl` file or open it in **ModelDoc**.
- If textures aren't displaying correctly:
  - Change the **Material Group** or default material to the correct one.
  - If there are extra material groups, remove them.
  - Click **"Needs Compiling"** to update changes.

✅ Done! You can now use your model wherever a mesh is needed.

## 🧠 Part 3 - Obsidian Notes

We're using **Obsidian** to manage all project documentation.  
If you want to contribute using Obsidian:

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
2. Click `Manage Vaults` → `Open Folder as Vault`.
3. Select the project folder.

📌 When adding images to any notes or readmes, please move them to the `Images/` folder so they stay organized.

## ✅ Tips

- **Use folders** for everything — it keeps the project clean and searchable.
- **Name things clearly** so both of us (and future contributors) understand what they are at a glance.
- **Commit often**, and use helpful messages — even autogenerated ones help with tracking changes.
