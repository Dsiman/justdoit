- Server duration: **1 week** (7 days)
    
- Objective: **Become the top player by the end**, measured in:
    
    - 🔹 **Matter collected**
        
    - 💰 **Money generated**
        
    - 🏗️ **Base size + claimed land**

## 📍 **Spawn Selection Phase**

### 🔲 **Claimable Map Grid**

- The world map is broken into **grid zones**.
    
- Each grid:
    
    - Has **hidden resource values** (stone, metal, etc.)
        
    - Shows **availability status** (claimed/unclaimed)
        
- **Claimed zones:**
    
    - Are **blacked out** until you explore them in-game
        
    - Are **locked** and cannot be selected for spawning
        
- **Unclaimed zones:**
    
    - Show approximate **resource richness** (via heat map or % bar)
        
    - Allow **pre-claim marking** before joining the server
        

### ✅ **Claiming System**

- Before spawning, you:
    
    1. Select an **unclaimed zone**
        
    2. Place a **Claim Marker** (shows resource stats within radius)
        
    3. If satisfied, place a **Resource Cupboard**
        
    4. Upon placing the cupboard, the zone becomes:
        
        - **Your territory** (build/protect/expand)
            
        - **Locked for other players**

## 🔒 **Territory Control System**

### 📦 **Resource Cupboard (RC) Mechanics**

- One **RC per player** initially (expandable via research)
    
- Defines your **build radius** and **resource ownership**
    
- Prevents others from building or spawning within its radius
    
- Can be **upgraded** to:
    
    - Expand radius
        
    - Increase defense
        
    - Auto-repair nearby structures
        
- If **destroyed** or **decays**, land becomes **neutral again**

## 🧭 **Exploration & Fog of War**

- **Blacked-out (fogged)** areas can only be explored physically
    
- Players must **venture out** to scout:
    
    - Other player bases
        
    - Resource nodes
        
    - Crap/junk fields
        
    - Strategic high-resource zones

## 🌍 **Resource Density Display**

- When selecting a spawn zone, you see estimated resources:
    
    - 📊 **Resource Display** (example):
        
        - Stone: ★★★☆☆
            
        - Metal: ★★☆☆☆
            
        - Sulfur: ★☆☆☆☆
            
        - Water: ✔️ Nearby spring
            
- This info is shown **before committing to claim**

## 🔄 **Player Loop Refinement**

1. **Pick a zone** → evaluate resources
    
2. **Place Claim Marker** → view radius/resource preview
    
3. **Confirm + Place Resource Cupboard**
    
4. **Spawn in + start from scratch**
    
5. **Gather, build, loot crap, demineralize**
    
6. **Expand tech, unlock printers**
    
7. **Defend territory + explore others**
    
8. **Endgame: Dominate with Money, Matter, Size**
